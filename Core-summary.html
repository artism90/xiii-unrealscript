/// UnrealScript Commandlet (command-line applet) class.
///
/// Commandlets are executed from the ucc.exe command line utility, using the
/// following syntax:
///
///     UCC.exe package_name.commandlet_class_name [parm=value]...
///
/// for example:
///
///     UCC.exe Core.HelloWorldCommandlet
///     UCC.exe Editor.MakeCommandlet
///
/// In addition, if you list your commandlet in the public section of your
/// package's .int file (see Engine.int for example), then your commandlet
/// can be executed without requiring a fully qualified name, for example:
///
///     UCC.exe MakeCommandlet
///
/// As a convenience, if a user tries to run a commandlet and the exact
/// name he types isn't found, then ucc.exe appends the text "commandlet"
/// onto the name and tries again.  Therefore, the following shortcuts
/// perform identically to the above:
///
///     UCC.exe Core.HelloWorld
///     UCC.exe Editor.Make
///     UCC.exe Make
///
/// It is also perfectly valid to call the Main method of a
/// commandlet class directly, for example from within the body
/// of another commandlet.
///
/// Commandlets are executed in a "raw" UnrealScript environment, in which
/// the game isn't loaded, the client code isn't loaded, no levels are
/// loaded, and no actors exist.

// Subsystem: The base class all subsystems. Subsystems usually
// correspond to large C++ classes. The benefit of defining a C++ class as
// a subsystem is that you can make some of its variables script-accessible,
// and you can make some of its properties automatically saveable as part
// of the configuration.

/// Time-management class.
/// Not yet implemented.
/// This is a built-in Unreal class and it shouldn't be modified.
///
/// Coordinated Universal Time or UCT is the world standard time 
/// representation which is independent of time zone and daylight
/// savings time.  The UCT standard supercedes the obsolete Grenwich
/// Mean Time (GMT).
///
/// UCT is technically the time on the zeroth meridian plus 12 hours.
/// For example, to convert UCT to EST (Eastern Standard Time), subtract 
/// 5 hours from UCT and then (??if dst).
///
/// By definition, UCT experiences a discontinuity when a leap second 
/// is reached. However, this discontinuity is never exposed while Unreal is
/// running, as UCT is determined at startup time, and UCT is updated
/// continuously during gameplay according to the CPU clock.
///
/// Unreal time is exposed as a long (a 64-bit signed quantity) and
/// is defined as nanoseconds elapsed since 
/// midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970.
///
/// For more information about UCT and time, see
///  http://www.bldrdoc.gov/timefreq/faq/faq.htm
